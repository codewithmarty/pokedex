## Future Work

- **Add Leveling Up and Battle Feature**: Pokemon have a myriad of information stored including the level and some battle attacks. It's not much of a stretch to include a battle feature where pokemon appear in the wild and pokemon in your team can level up.
- **Gym Battles**: Adding gym battles where not only users can earn badges, but they can also qualify for the indigo plateau and train their team.
- **Evolution**: This one's a bit tricky as the current PokeAPI does not contain information regarding when a pokemon evolves and their next evolved form. I would have to include this information myself and add some logic to get evolutions underway.
- **SocketIO**: Allowing battles across different users would be a nice long-term goal to achieve.
