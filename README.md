## Future Work

- **A working CPU**: The original plan for the game included the option of facing an AI (CPU). However, due to time constraints, this was not possible. 
- **SocketIO**: This current version of Connect Four implements two player gameplay so long as the two people are sharing a single machine. The hope is to one day expand this game to allow for remote gameplay. One day, two people from a distance away will be able to play my version of Connect Four.
- **UI Enhancement**: This is a given but the hope is to include animations as the current implementation of the game does not have chips falling into place. I'd also like to further develop the styling of my application. It is a functional game, but these UI enhancements will further the experience of those playing my version of the classic connect four.
